# A3C-Agent

## This model was trained to act on the atari casino game environment. The A3C model approach for reinforcement learning was implemented using neural network which included the convolutional neural network and the artificial neural network. This neural network combined architecture was used by the A3C agent where the critic learned the Q-values and the actor learned the policy based on the Q-values. 

## Tech stack used:

* **pytorch:** Used for defining the neural network and the agent architecture.
* **Gymnasium:** Used for accessing the atari casino game environment for the agent to train on.
* **OpenCV:** Used for converting the game images to gray scale
